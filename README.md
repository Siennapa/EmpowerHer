### Elevator pitch

EmpowerHer is a supportive website for teen girls and young women to learn about safety, boundaries, leadership, confidence, and mental wellness. Members read bite-size lessons, share real experiences in topic circles, and encourage each other with kind, constructive comments. Optional AI helps draft respectful boundary scripts and confidence prompts, while curated resources keep crisis help one click away. Itâ€™s a gentle, private, and uplifting space â€” education first, community always.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

**HTML**
- Single HTML entry (index.html) for a React SPA (desktop-first layout; also responsive down to tablet/phone)
- Semantic structure for header, nav, main, footer, accessible forms and labels
- Web meta: viewport, Open Graph, and favicon to API/CDN

**CSS** 
- Desktop-first CSS Grid/Flex layout; breakouts for tablet/phone
- Design tokens for color/spacing/typography; high contrast for readability
- Hover/focus/active states; visible focus rings
- Image handling: responsive max-width: 100%, object-fit, and a simple lightbox on desktop

**React** 
- Stack: React + react-router-dom
- Routes: / (feed), /login, /register, /create, /post/:id, /profile, /admin
- Components: Navbar, AuthForm, PostCard, PostDetail, ResponseCard, Top3Picker (HTML5 DnD + keyboard), TallyPanel, Uploader, AiAdvicePanel, AdminDashboard
- Perf: code-split heavy views with React.lazy; prefetch data on hover for desktop
- A11y: Proper ARIA for lists/cards, drag handles, live region updates on tally changes

**Service** 
- Stack
- Security for browsers
- Auth
- Uploads
- Posts/Responses
- Voting
- AI and public API: calls AI provider server-side and returns normalized tips

**DB/Login** 
- Postgres, MySQL, or MongoDB
- Schema
- Indexes
- Tallies: compute on read or cache weighted scores

**WebSocket**
- Room per post: post:{postID}
- Client subscribes when mounts, cleans up on unmount
