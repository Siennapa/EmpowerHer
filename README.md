### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

**HTML**
- Single index.html (React SPA), semantic structure (header/nav/main/footer), accessible forms and labels, meta/OG tags

**CSS**

- Subtle animations on card hover, comment appear, and checklist completion.

**React**

- Components: Navbar, CircleList, PostCard, PostDetail, CommentList, BoundaryBuilder, AffirmationCard, LeaderSpotlightCard, LessonCard, JournalEditor, ReportButton, AdminQueue
- State: Auth context (protected routes), optimistic comment posting, realtime updates via WebSocket (new comments/edits/auto-hide)

**Service** 
- Auth
- Circles/Posts/Comments
- Lessons/Journal

- 3rd-party proxy endpoints (meets course "public API")
- Boundary Builder (AI optional)

**DB/Login**
